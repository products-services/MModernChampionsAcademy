<b>Topic 1 : Understanding What Life Is?<br><br></b>

<b>Topic 2 : Nigeria And The World Of Today And The Future.</b><br><br>

Nigeria As Of Today Has Changed Considerably And You Have To Change "Considerably" As Well, If You Want To Survive And Thrive In Nigeria Of Today.Also Charles Darwin Stated in His 1859 Thesis "The Origin Of Species" That Survivial And Thriving In Any Sitution Or Cicumstance Does Not Go To The Strongest Or Most Intelligent But To The Most Adaptative To Changes in Its Environment. Well You Can Go Abroad Also Called "Japaing" , But It Comes With Its Own Problems Like Racism Due To Difference In Skin Color E.t.c<br><br>

Regardless Of How Anti - Citizen Nigeria Government Is Towards Its Citizen, There Are Some Truths That Are Unchanging And Constant As The Throne Of Yahweh - Himself And This Truths  Includes:-<br><br>

"People - Nigerians Have And Will Always Have Needs That Must Be Satisfied Periodically, Some Daily, Some Two Weeks, Also Called ForthNightly, Some Monthly, Some 3 Months, Some 4 Months, Some 6 Months, Some 1 Year E.t c Just like That, Like Drinking 5 Litres Of Water Daily, To Eating Food Two Or Three Times Daily, To Buying Clothes To Cover Nakedness Or For As An Expression Of Personal Statement Or Style, Telecommunication Networks Airtime Purchases For Business And Chatting Up On Events And Issues, Detergent For Clothes, Deodorant And Other Personal Hygiene Care E.t.c. The Truth Is And Will Always Be - People Have And Will Always Have, Repeatedly Also,Needs That They Must Satisfied And Living Also Called Income Can Be Made By Satisfying These Needs Of People In Sufficient Quantities Faster, Cheaper, Better Than Other People Servicing With The Same Product(s) And Servivce(s) Or Similiar Product(s) And Service(s)!!!<br><br>

<i>Be Happy,<br>
Be Joyous,<br>
